# Contributing (Futuro Fortissimo book)

## Golden rule: citations

**Only cite what is includible:**
- **Corpus (FF.x.y)**
- **Notes** (only if the note is itself includible / internal)

### External links
If you encounter an **external source/link** in a chapter:
1) **Replace it with a better internal support** (preferred): add a short sentence supported by the corpus + an FF.x.y citation.
2) If you cannot replace it: **rewrite/remove** the claim.

Do **not** leave external citations as the only support.

## Style
- Additions should be incremental, in the same voice.
- Prefer **1–3 sentences** per injection, but make them *meaningful* (not fluff).
- When expanding, aim for: clearer causal chain, better examples, and an explicit “so what”.

## Citation format (HTML)
Use the existing pattern:

```html
<div class="citation">
  <div class="citation-ref">(<a href="https://fortissimo.substack.com/...">🦞 ff.144.2 ...</a>)</div>
  <p>…text…</p>
</div>
```

## SEO basics (no keyword stuffing)
- Headings should be explicit and scannable.
- Use descriptive `alt` on images.
- Add internal cross-links where relevant (within the book).
